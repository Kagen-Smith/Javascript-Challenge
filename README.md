## Description
[visit the Deployed site]()

This coding challef was about changing the HTML and CSS dynamically using javascript in browser. In this challenge we were told to add javascript code to allow a user to add employee data: First name, Last name, salary. and then have those values displayed on the HTML file. We also needed to calculate the average salary and have a random employee selected for a raffle.

## learning points

In this challenge I learned how to ad a event listener to run a function, I learned how to make a object out of an array, I learned how to calculate the average of an object, and how to use a math function to choose a random object.
